# password-checker

This is supposed to be a utility. It can be used as a quick security check before creating a new password or if you wanna see whether your current passwords are holding up good.

You'll need the `pwinput` package for the password input.

After installing the package, just execute the file with python3.8: `python3.8 main.py`
